# CS780 Solved Midsem

## Install:

- Gymnasium: `pip install gymnasium`
- Similarly, numpy, matplotlib.

## File Structure:

- `Problem1.ipynb`, `Problem2.ipynb`, `Problem3.ipynb`, `RME_file.py`

## Initiation:

- **Load the python files in the jupyter notebook:** `%load_ext autoreload` and then `%autoreload 2`

- **Import all the functions and classes from all python files:** `import RME_file.py` in Problem2 and Problem3.

- **To use functions and classes in different python file in jupyter notebook:** `PythonFileName.function()`

## Note:

- The notebook is divided into sections of solutions for each subproblem.

- Important to have all dependencies in all the files and notebook to use functions from them.

- Just run cells one by one in order to get the desired result. If not, kindly check the github link provided in the report file.

- Have used Jupyter Lab instead of Google Colab, as it works better in my laptop.
- I have used a different virtual environment for both the midsem and assignment, so it might have differnet dependencies installed than other's localhost.
